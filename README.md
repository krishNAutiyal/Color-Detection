The Color Detection Project is a tool designed to detect and identify the color of objects in an image using their RGB values. This project is built using Python and OpenCV, which processes images and detects color by capturing the RGB values of the pixels. The tool can be used for a variety of purposes, including object identification, color-based sorting, or enhancing user interfaces where color recognition is needed.
